### **About the Game**

Kaiju Kablooey is a first person game where players play as a giant monster rampaging through a city. This game is an immersive Virtual Reality experience on the Oculus Quest 2.
<br> 
<br>
The player will be taking the role of a giant monster, going through the destruction of a city by using their arms to smash buildings, tear buildings from their foundations, grab people, and throw objects, as well as use their head to aim a long range attack to blast buildings and people from afar. The buildings will have realistic and satisfying destruction. As the player continues through the game there will be a military that will progressively increase in force the more the player destroys. The player can either go through the city in a sandbox for however long they want, or choose a more goal oriented mode.
