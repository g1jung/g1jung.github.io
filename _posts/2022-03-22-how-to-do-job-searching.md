From Roland Shum

Hey everyone, as I've finished my job search I'd like to offer to help anyone with their technical interviews, whether by doing mock interviews or preparing for one. The following is what I used to prepare for big companies. Be aware that each company would do things differently; Epic likes to keep the technical questions small.

Interview Breakdown
Technical interviews are wide and varied, but there are three main parts that you can prepare for.

1) Technical Question
  This part of the interview tests your depth of knowledge and how well you work with your interviewer on the given problem. Study up Leetcode Easy/Medium questions.

  Notes: Remember to talk about the solution and converse with the interviewer. Don't dive straight into the code! Ask what the interviewer wants; what are the constraints etc. Most interviewers are attempting to judge if you can work with their team.

2) Behavioral Questions 
 
"My interactions with many students preparing and giving interviews have made me realise that students do not prepare enough for behavioural questions in general. They treat these categories of questions as secondary but fail to realise that a good leadership answer can change the interviewers perspective towards them as a prospective new hire."

  Giving a great BQ answer propels your value as a candidate, while giving a bad answer instantly puts you into the drop list. Use the extra time you have to prepare.

  Notes: The link above generally covers everything you will face. You really only need 5 examples in your head and tweak each one to answer the question. Remember to ask yourself, "What is the interviewer trying to understand about me with this question?"
Level up your coding skills and quickly land a job. This is the best place to expand your knowledge and get prepared for your next interview.

3) Resume Questions
This part of the interview involves the interviewer asking you about the experience you have listed on the resume. Keep for yourself a copy of the resume you've sent to the company, and be prepared to talk about every single bullet point. If possible, somehow relate that to the position you're applying for.

Order of Preperation:
  Behavior Questions    (spend a good day coming up with answers with different projects)
  Resume                (spend half a day reviewing resume before interview)
  Technical Questions   (Keep doing 1-2 easy/medium leetcode questions each day)

As before, I'm open to holding mock interviews or discussing in a 1:1 setting on how to improve your answers. Each company holds questions differently and this by no means is an all-encompassing preparation for a technical interview. But this gives you a better chance then most applicants that aren't preparing out there.

As I am a graduating senior, I will be closing this discord by the end of the semester. I hope everyone good luck in their job hunt and congragulate those that have finished theirs.
